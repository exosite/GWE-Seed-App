# Getting Started

## Configure Murano

1. Create a Murano account and log in to your account (https://exosite.com/signup/).

2. Choose to create a New Product. *Start from scratch* as a starting point. Use whatever product name you like.

3. Add a New Device called "Gateway". Use your gateway's MAC address as the Identity. Example format "00:08:00:4A:02:25".

4. Add another New Device called "Test Data". Use "12345" as the Identity.

5. Add the "test" resource to your "Test Data" device as a float.

6. Add the "usage_report", "engine_report", "device_info", "update_interval", "engine_fetch", and "fetch_status" resources to your "Gateway" device as strings.

7. Create an empty solution in Murano. Name it whatever you like. 

8. Install the Exosite CLI tool. https://github.com/exosite/exosite-cli

	```
	pip install exosite
	```

9. Clone the GWE Seed App repository to your machine.

	```
	git clone https://github.com/exosite/GWE-Seed-App
	```

10. Init the Exosite program.

	```
	cd GWE-Seed-App
	exosite --init
	```

11. Deploy the solution.

## Configure The Gateway

2. Set the update interval to post data every minute.

	```
	gwe -t 60
	```

3. Install the gmq-sine-demo onto the Gateway using the documentation https://github.com/exosite/gmq-sine-demo. Use the device identity as the Serial when prompted (12345).

4. Navigate to your solution page and check to see the data is flowing.
